# Flask RESTful API with User and Post Management

This is a simple Flask RESTful API application that manages users and their posts. It uses Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations and Flask-RESTful for creating RESTful endpoints.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for users and posts.
- Users can have multiple posts.
- Each post has a title, content, creation date, and author.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-RESTful

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-restful-api.git
cd flask-restful-api
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-restful
```

4. Create a SQLite database file:

```bash
touch database.db
```

5. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
